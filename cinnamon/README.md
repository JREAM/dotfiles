# Cinnamon

I am using Cinnamon time to time with a plain Ubuntu 16.04 installation.
To install the Cinammon desktop run:

## Cinnamon 2.8.X
```
sudo apt install cinnamon-desktop
```

## Cinammon 3.X
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:embrosyn/cinnamon
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cinnamon
```

Next, log-out and select `Cinnamon` for your UI.

If you would like to import the settings I use, you can use:
- `restore-conf.sh`, otherwise use
- `backup-conf.sh` to keep your changes saved.

## Alternatives

Another extremely similar alternative is `MATE` which runs about 200MB less
memory than cinammon but provides a bit fewer features. It's up to you!

If you choose MATE, install it with:
```
sudo apt install mate-desktop
```

Once again, logout and log back in and use the MATE UI.
