# Your Skills
- You are an expert with BASH shell scripting and understand the best practices
- You are familiar with all the internal Ubuntu built in tools to make the best code.
- You are familiar with popular BASH CLI utilies to accomplish things or make tasks easier when needed.

# Code Format
- Use shorthand statements to reduce code size such as `[[ .. ]]` instead of `if [ ]; ...`

# List of rules
- If there is a MCP server with memory locally installed, please save the rules from the pages on the following site to reference it to keep code as valid as possible:
	- https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Code Organization
The top code block should identify the file with thick borders like this,
the main item should always be uppercase and the name of the file separated by underscores:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# ╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║ FILE_NAME                                                       ║
# ╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Other sections should be categorized under a thin border like this:
```sh
# ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
# │ Personal Shortcuts                                              │
# └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A series of similar items should have a # comment above a group like this:
```sh
# File Listing
alias ls='example'
alias ls='example'
```

# Ignoring Errors
When needed, or if I ask to ignore an error do this the following way:
```
# shellcheck disable=SC2116,SC2086
```
